# ASE Slab Generator (Improved Version)

This repository provides an enhanced tool for generating crystal slabs for atomic simulations, improving upon the standard slab generation features available in the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/).

## Limitations of Standard ASE Slab Tool

Although ASE provides basic function `surface()` for generating crystal slabs, users may encounter several issues:

- **Cannot use primitive cells**: `surface()` can only use conventional cells, not primitive cells.
- **Incomplete Surface Enumeration**: Although multiple slab structures can theoretically exist for a given cleavage plane specified by Miller indices (hkl), the `surface()` always returns only a single structure.
- **Manual Adsorbate Placement**: Accurately placing adsorbates on arbitrary surfaces often requires tedious manual adjustments, excepting some special structures.

## What This Tool Offers

This improved slab generator `surfaces()` in `general_surfaces.py` addresses the above issues by:

- **Primitive cells available**: Both the conventional cells and primitive cells can be used.
- **Systematically Enumerating All Terminations**: A general and exhaustive approach was used to slab generations based on “SlabGenom” algorithm originally developed by Satomichi Nishihara. He used this algorithm in a Java-based application [BURAI](https://github.com/BURAI-team/burai).
- **Flexible Adsorbate Support**: Allows general controls over adsorbate positioning by considering "dangling bonds" created when cutting the bulk crystal.

e.g.) Two surfaces are generated for ZnO(100) with H or OH terminations.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/korintje/ase_slab_gen.git
```

Make sure you have ASE installed (e.g., via pip install ase).

### Basic Usage

Here's a minimal example to generate all symmetry-unique (111) slabs of silicon:

After cloning, you can import the surfaces function from the general_surfaces module in your Python script to begin generating slabs.
Here is a basic example demonstrating how to generate slabs for a silicon crystal:

```python
from ase import Atoms
from ase.build import bulk
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from ase.visualize.plot import plot_atoms
from general_surfaces import surfaces

# Create a bulk
zno_bulk = bulk("OZn", crystalstructure="wurtzite", a=3.289, b=3.289, c=5.307, alpha=90.000, u=None)

# Set hkl indices
h, k, l = 1, 0, 0

# Define adsorbates
hydroxyl = Atoms('OH', positions=[[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0.96]])
ads = [
    {"adsorbate": "H", "on": "O", "bond_length": 1.0},
    {
        "adsorbate": hydroxyl, 
        "on": "Zn", 
        "bond_length": 1.5, 
        "ads_atom_index": 0,
    },            
]

# Create all possible slabs (e.g. Two surfaces for ZnO(100))
slabs = surfaces(zno_bulk, (h, k, l), 4, vacuum=10.0, adsorbates=ads)

# Save slab images
fig, axarr = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(10, 5), dpi=300)
for i, slab in enumerate(slabs):
    ext_slab = slab * (4, 4, 1)
    plot_atoms(ext_slab, axarr[i], rotation=('-90x,-90y,0z'))
fig.savefig(f"ZnO_100.png")
```

### Parameters
```
def surfaces(
    lattice: Atoms,
    miller_indices: tuple[int, int, int],
    num_layers: int,
    vacuum: float = 0.0,
    orthogonal: bool = True,
    adsorbates: list = []
) -> list[Atoms]
```
- `lattice`: Bulk lattice structure of alloy or pure metal. Both the conventional cell and primitive cell can be used as the unit cell. One can also give the chemical symbol as a string, in which case the correct bulk lattice will be generated automatically.
- `miller_indices`: Surface normal in Miller indices (h,k,l).
- `layers`: Number of equivalent layers of the slab.
- `vacuum`: Amount of vacuum added on both sides of the slab.
- `orthogonal`: Whether the lattice will be converted to that whose upper plane is perpendicular to the normal vector specified by h, k, l
- `adsorbates`: list of adsorbates mapping formatted as below:
  - `adsorbate` (str, Atom, or Atoms): Adsorbate atom (molecule) object or its symbol
  - `on` (str): Elemental symbol of the atom which the adsorbate will adsorb on.
  - `bond_length` (float): Bond length between the adsorbate and the surface atom. If not specified, bond length of the dangling bond from the surface atom should have in the bulk cell will be applied.
  - `ads_atom_index` (int): Index of the atom in Atoms object which will be bounded with the surface atom. If not specified, index 0 is used by default.
